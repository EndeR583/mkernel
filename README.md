# mKernel
Original creator: https://os.phil-opp.com/
Check his blog out, it's really helpful.
A 64 bit kernel made with Rust.
Feel free to contribute, expand this project.
In the first place, I want to make a working shell and in the future I would like this to be a complete OS.
It is a fresh project so it contains the very basics so far (macros for printing text/changing color etc).

Build:
  cargo xbuild
  cargo bootimage

After building the .bin file, you can run it in QEMU or put it on a USB stick and boot it.
I left some TODOs in the comments.
